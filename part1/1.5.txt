Alpine tagged image has a size of around 16 MBs, which is much less than the ubuntu tagged images 83MBs.

I was not sure what to report for this exercise, but here are the commands to run the sh in the alpine version of the image and the same secret message.

1. docker tag devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine alpine
2. docker run -d -it --name alpine alpine
3. docker exec -it alpine sh
4. (within the container) tail -f ./text.log

Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
