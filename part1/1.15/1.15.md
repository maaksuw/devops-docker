Link to GitHub repository on DockerHub. In the README I explained the problem I had with containerizing this project: I wanted to choose one of my own older projects, since the documentations for those were not made with containerization in mind and I thought it would be fun. I was able to figure out the dependencies for this TM project and got Docker to spin up the container and run the application, but as I explained in the README, it seems JavaFX/GUI applications are not very compatible with Docker containers, which I did not know before. (I am able to natively run this project with the same dependencies installed, so those are not the problem.) I hope this meets the standards for this exercise for now (I got the Dockerfile otherwise constructed and published the image to DockerHub) even though the application will now give an error about displays when the container is run.
