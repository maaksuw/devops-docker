The Dockerfiles are in the respective directories.
The sizes before this exercise are:
Frontend: 1.07 GB
Backend: 1.27 GB
The sizes after this exercise are:
Frontend: 1.07 GB
Backend: 1.27 GB
Both images are quite large now, so the change in reducing the number of layers is likely too small to be visible here.
This is likely due to the fact that in part 1, I created the Dockerfiles from pre-installed images for Node.js and Goland, not from Linux. The instructions there simply said to find suitable images, I did not know this would be an exercise later, my apologies. I also did not know which approach was better for the exercises then (to start from linux or look for a pre-installed image), so I hope this is okay.
As such there were also not many useless parts here, since we simply install the npm dependencies and build the projects.
I will change the base images to alpine versions in the next step.
