In case it is not clear from the graph/picture, I tried to put together a graph about the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster, that has a control plane and two worker nodes. All of these could be placed on separate machines, so we would have three machines/hosts. Other agents in the graph are the client contacting the cluster through Ingresses and an admin machine that sends command and control messages to the control plane in the cluster. Overall, there are three different types of containers deployed in the pods in the two nodes, the frontend and backend belonging to one application and the container named static to another one. There are three types of services (front, back and static) that are used as communicating points for the respective pods.
